# DSA210-Project

This project examines the impact of weather conditions (temperature, rainfall, humidity, and more) on coffee sales trends across three different coffee shop brands in the same areas of New York City. By combining sales data with historical weather records, we seek to uncover whether customers' choice of coffee shop and product type (hot vs. iced drinks, specialty items, etc.) is influenced by daily weather fluctuations.
Through data analysis and visualization, this project provides insights that could be valuable for coffee shop owners, marketers, and supply chain managers in optimizing their offerings based on expected weather conditions.

Motivation
Consumer behavior in coffee purchasing is influenced by multiple factors, including location, pricing, and seasonal trends. However, one critical yet often overlooked factor is weather conditions. Does weather impact sales patterns across different coffee shop brands in the same area? Does cold weather increase hot coffee sales while reducing iced beverage purchases? This project aims to analyze how weather patterns affect consumer preferences for different coffee shop brands in New York City.

Objectives
* Analyze the correlation between daily weather patterns and coffee shop sales trends.
* Compare customer preferences for different coffee shop brands under varying weather conditions.
* Determine if weather impacts product type selection, such as hot vs. iced beverages.
* Provide data-driven recommendations for coffee businesses to adjust their strategies based on seasonal trends.

Data:
Find Data
